## Exploratory Project

I want to make a game that's kind of like a tank game in a maze. It requires 2 players to play, and the tanks can be controlled by the WASD or arrow keys. To include physics, I want to give 2 abilities that the players can choose from: the first ability makes a wind force that goes outwards from the player's position (this wind will only affect bullets, not maze walls or anything else), and the second ability creates a strong attraction force around the player's bullet. Whenever the ability is used, the tank cannot use it again for 10 seconds. Also, the map will not be randomly generated. The bullets can reflect off the maze walls up to 5 times before having a particle explosion. At the same time, if one of the tanks is hit, whether by an enemy bullet or from their own, the tank will have a particle explosion, and the game will be replaced by a screen that says "Player [number] wins!"
